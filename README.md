# CppHospitalManagement

This C++ program is designed to manage and analyze hospital information.  
It uses **structures (`struct`)** to store details about each hospital, including:
- **Name**
- **Address**
- **Establishment date** (year, month, day)
- **Area size**
- **Number of doctors**
- **Number of patients**

Features
1. **Find the hospital with the most patients** and display its details.
2. **Identify the oldest hospital** based on its establishment date.
3. **Count the hospitals** that have at least 50 doctors **and** an area greater than 1000 units.
4. **Find the hospital with the most doctors** and display its details.
5. **Display all hospital records** entered by the user.

How it Works
- The program dynamically allocates memory for the hospital records.
- The user enters the data for each hospital.
- The program processes the data to produce the above results.
- Finally, the allocated memory is released.

This project demonstrates **basic data structures, dynamic memory allocation, and conditional logic in C++**.
